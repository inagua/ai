In [machine learning](machine-learning.html) and [deep learning](deep-learning.html), a model is an object that transforms input data (e.g., an image) 
into the desired output (e.g., a text label for the image) through a number of successive mathematical operations. 

A model has parameters (called [weights](weight.html)) that can be tuned during [training](training.html).


In deep-learning parlance, sometimes we use network as a synonym for model. 

As sample, a minimalist model can be an implementation of linear regression.
