> Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of [TensorFlow](tensorflow.html), CNTK, or Theano. 
> It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

__Keras__ provides a set of the most frequently-used types of [neural-network](neural-network.html) [layers](layer.html), 
each with configurable parameters.
