One of the most important features of TensorFlow is that we can save the trained model as a binary file.

The reason why TensorFlow is good at creating [neural networks](neural-network.html) is that it doesnâ€™t actually create a neural network from scratch. 
Instead, it retrains an existing [classifier](classifier.html) called [Inception](inception.html).

compile / optimizer=sgd (stochastic gradient descent) loss=mwan_squared_error

__TensorFlow__ can be used with [Keras](keras.html).

- Layers API ~ Keras 
- with import/export models with them
