In [neural networks](neural-network.html), the __Loss function__ measures the guessed answers against the known correct answers 
and measures how well or how badly it did.

It is used with the [Optimizer](optimizer.html) .

The neural network will repeat this for the number of [epochs](epoch.html). 

An example of Loss function is the 'Mean Squared Error'.
