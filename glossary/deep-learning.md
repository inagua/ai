Deep Learning (a part of [Machine Learning](/ai/glossary/machine-learning.html)) does not need feature engineering. We can use the raw pixels 
from the image as the features. This is mainly possible because the classifier used in Deep Learning is a [neural network](/ai/glossary/neural-network.html).

The study and application of deep [neural networks](/ai/glossary/neural-network.html) (i.e., using a large number of successive representational 
transformations to solve machine-learning problems.)
