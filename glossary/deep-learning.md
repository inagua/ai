Deep Learning, a part of [Machine Learning](/ai/glossary/machine-learning.html), does not need feature engineering. We can use the raw pixels 
from the image as the features. This is mainly possible because the [classifier](classifier.html) used in Deep Learning is a [neural network](/ai/glossary/neural-network.html).

It is the study and application of deep [neural networks](/ai/glossary/neural-network.html) (i.e., using a large number of successive representational 
transformations to solve machine-learning problems.)
