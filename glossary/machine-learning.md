# {{ page.title }}

A subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that:
- automates the discovery of rules for solving complex problems 
- by using __data labeled__ with the desired __answers__. 

Machine Learning is a system that learns from __examples__ and __experiences__.

It differs from classical programming in that no handcrafting of the rules is involved.
