# {{ page.title }}

A subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that:
- automates the discovery of rules for solving complex problems 
- by using __data labeled__ with the desired __answers__. 

Machine Learning is a system that learns from __examples__ and __experiences__.

It differs from classical programming in that no handcrafting of the rules is involved.

        - and object detection.


## Datasets

The learning is based on a set of data, called the __training set__.

But, once the training is done, it is important to check the accuracy of the learning. For that the algorithm should be played on a new set of data: the __test set__.


## Bias and techniques

It is better to label with number rather than text (that depends on a given language).
